I'm Nikola Stojanoviƒá, an iOS software engineer by trade and a data engineering enthusiast by passion. I spend my days crafting user friendly native applications and my nights delving into the intricate world of data engineering.

## üì± Mobile Software Engineer

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on applications used by millions of people worldwide, such as [mobile.de](https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/mobile-de-car-market/id378563358) while it was owned by eBay. This vast and varied experience has given me the skills and confidence to handle projects of any scale and complexity. 

I strongly believe in the balance of strong platform development and thoughtful product orientation in creating the best software. On one hand, as a platform developer, I'm skilled at modularizing applications and designing ergonomic, developer-friendly APIs. This technical proficiency ensures efficient and maintainable codebases, setting a solid foundation for any application's infrastructure.

On the other hand, I understand the importance of being product-oriented. I strive to empathize with the end-user, focusing on creating intuitive, user-friendly experiences. I take the time to understand user needs and pain points, and I incorporate this understanding into every aspect of my development process.

## üíª Backend API & Web Development

In addition to mobile development, I've honed my skills in both backend API development and frontend web development. My backend expertise lies in creating robust and scalable APIs using Node.js and AWS. On the frontend, I've built responsive, user-friendly websites with React, TypeScript, and Next.js. 

This diverse skill set gives me a holistic understanding of the software development lifecycle. I can smoothly navigate between different layers of a project, from backend infrastructure and APIs to frontend mobile and web interfaces. 

Whether I'm working on a small website or a complex application used by millions, my goal remains the same: to deliver efficient, reliable, and user-friendly solutions.

## üåå Data Engineering Enthusiast

Data is at the heart of every decision we make. It fuels our understanding and drives our innovation. With this in mind, I've developed a keen interest in data engineering, dedicating my free time to exploring this vast domain.

Recently, my exploration has led me to Apache Spark, a powerful open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. With its capabilities for handling big data workloads, Spark has opened up new possibilities for extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data.

My fascination lies not just in the mechanics of data collection and storage, but also in the art of data analysis. I relish in the challenge of sifting through complex datasets to unearth valuable insights that can inform decision-making. The potential of data engineering to solve real-world problems keeps me motivated to learn and grow in this field.

## ‚ö° Personal Projects

I strongly believe that learning is an infinite journey, and one of the most effective ways to continue this journey is by working on personal projects. These projects provide a platform where I can explore new ideas, technologies, and methodologies. It's where I can push my boundaries, unafraid to make mistakes and eager to learn from them.

Currently, I'm invested in an open-source initiative ‚Äì a [science quiz platform](https://github.com/SciQuizHero). This platform is designed to be accessible via native [iOS](https://github.com/SciQuizHero/SciQuizHero-iOS-client) and [Android](https://github.com/SciQuizHero/SciQuizHero-Android-client) applications. The goal is to make learning science fun and engaging through gamification. It's an exciting blend of my passion for software engineering and education.

Feel free to take a look at the progress on this project and others on my GitHub profile. Any feedback or contributions to the code are highly appreciated!
